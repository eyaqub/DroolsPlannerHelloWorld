A very simple introductory example use of drools planner. Feel free to branch and play around. Merge requests won't be accepted unless for a critical bug ( it's just a starting point example anyway ). There are some improvements that can be made to the example, left as an exercise.

Please see the related blog post about this at:  http://whimsycode.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/drools-planner-introduction-by-example/

Have fun!
